# LaTeX CV Template

A LaTeX CV template originally based on [Murat Can Karacabey's LaTeX CV](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv). This version does not require lualatex (I use pdflatex). Also the font is changed to [Roboto Thin](https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/robotothin/).

The CV is made up of `longtables` to create a clean listing of all the cool stuff you did.

Since I didn't want to publish all my details I created a sample CV for famous Erika Mustermann.

Feel free to use this template and to fit it to your own needs.
